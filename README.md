# D3-Challenge
D3-Challenge project
This project is an analysis of  information from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System.  The data set included with the assignment is based on 2014 ACS 1-year estimates from the US Census Bureau. The current data set includes data on rates of income, obesity, poverty, etc. by state. The final product is a scatter chart showing the percent of the population by state that 1) lacks healthcare and 2) is obese, vs. poverty, age, and household income.
